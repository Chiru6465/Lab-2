## Lab Overview

This lab focused on implementing modern CSS layout techniques using Flexbox, Grid, and Transitions. The objective was to modify only the `styles.css` file to match the provided example layouts without editing the HTML structure (except for adding my name as instructed).

All layout and styling changes were completed strictly within the selectors provided in the starter CSS file.

## Implementation Summary

### Flexbox – Part 1
Created a horizontal navigation bar with evenly distributed spacing using:
- `display: flex`
- `justify-content: space-evenly`
- Reset default list spacing (margin and padding)

### Flexbox – Part 2
Converted list items into three equal-width columns and reordered them using:
- `flex: 1`
- `order` property

### Flexbox – Part 3
- Centered the card both horizontally and vertically using:
  - `justify-content: center`
  - `align-items: center`
- Converted the tag list into a flexible wrapped layout using `flex-wrap` and spacing.

### Grid – Part 1
Built a four-column responsive grid using:
- `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr)`
- `grid-auto-rows: 100px`
- `gap: 20px`

### Grid – Part 2
Positioned overlapping grid items using:
- Grid line placement
- `z-index` for stacking order

### Grid – Part 3
Created a structured webpage-style layout using:
- Fractional column widths (`2fr 1fr`)
- Defined row heights (100px, 300px, 100px)
- Grid spanning across columns

### Transitions
